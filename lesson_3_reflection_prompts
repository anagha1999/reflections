When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

        I'd keep my work local if I was working on a solo project and had access to my laptop's HDD at all times. A remote repository seems like a more viable option when you need to work on a project 'on the go' from different systems - and with different people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually pulling makes more logical sense if you're working on a group project. You can experiment around with your tasks locally, and then when they're finally ready for everyone to see, push them on github

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are used when you want to copy one person's online repo onto your online repo - and you don't mind this being visible publicly
    clones are used when you wish to privately work OFFLINE on someone's online repo  
    branches are used when you want to create your own version of some code - without affecting the original (online/offline)
